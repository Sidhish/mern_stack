React is a java script library used for building UI especially for single page website 
React don't have: 
                1.its own routing facility(navigating)
                2.its own state management tool (data retraining from one page to other)
                3.its own build method
React js is a open sourced library managed by Facebook (meta)
It is a single page website because it only have a single html file(index.html) which handles every thing
Components based approach 
Reusability
Declare your part -> Rest is handled by ReactJs
Little optimized and fast (single page)
Virtual DOM
External Library accessibility

Angular
It is a FrameWork
It has routing facility, state management, own building methods
managed by Google

🧠 React vs Angular – Comparison Notes
🔷 React
✅ Type: JavaScript Library

✅ Purpose: Used for building User Interfaces, especially Single Page Applications (SPA).

✅ Maintained By: Meta (Facebook)

✅ Routing: ❌ Does not have built-in routing.
➤ Requires external libraries like React Router.

✅ State Management: ❌ Does not have a built-in state management tool.
➤ Use tools like Redux, Context API, Recoil, etc.

✅ Build Tools: ❌ No native build system.
➤ Use tools like Vite, Webpack, or Create React App (CRA).

✅ Flexibility: Highly flexible – you can choose your own routing, state management, etc.

✅ Component-Based: Everything is built using reusable components.

✅ Learning Curve: Easier to get started with (especially for beginners).

🔶 Angular
✅ Type: Complete JavaScript Framework

✅ Purpose: Used for building complex, large-scale web applications.

✅ Maintained By: Google

✅ Routing: ✅ Has a built-in Router module.

✅ State Management: ✅ Can handle state using RxJS, NgRx, or Angular services.

✅ Build Tools: ✅ Comes with its own CLI (Command Line Interface) for scaffolding, building, and testing.

✅ Structure: Offers strict structure and patterns (MVC).

✅ All-in-One: Comes with everything out-of-the-box (routing, HTTP, forms, etc.)

✅ Learning Curve: Steeper due to its size and complexity.
